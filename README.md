# CS-350: Fundamentals of Computing Systems - Fall 2023

## Course Overview
This repository contains my homework submissions for CS-350, focusing on the fundamentals of computing systems, including system abstractions, performance metrics, resource management, and concurrency.

## Homework Assignments

### HW1: Measuring CPU Clock Frequency
- **Description:** Implementing methods to measure the CPU clock frequency using sleep-based and busy-waiting approaches.

### HW2: Server Queue Management
- **Description:** Enhancing a server's capabilities to manage incoming requests and safeguard internal resources under high traffic, with the ability to reject requests when necessary.

### HW3: Multi-threaded Request Processing
- **BUILD Problem 1:** Refining server request handling to manage queue overflows.
- **BUILD Problem 2:** Implementing multiple worker threads for efficient request processing.

### HW4: Enhanced Multi-threading and Request Handling
- **Description:** Further development of multi-threaded request processing, focusing on concurrent operation and request handling efficiency.

### HW6: Image Processing Server
- **Description:** Creating an image processing server capable of handling real-world workload variations, including operations on raster images.

### HW7: Multi-threaded Image Processing with Synchronization
- **Description:** Advancing the image processing server to a multi-threaded architecture with semaphore-based synchronization to ensure operation correctness.

## Academic Integrity
All work in this repository is my own, adhering to BU's Academic Code of Conduct. Collaborative discussions were allowed, but the final submission is the result of my individual effort.
